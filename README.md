# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX

This project summarizes the work that has been done during the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialization.

## Background
SpaceX, a leader in the commercial space industry, is revolutionizing space travel by making it more affordable and accessible. Its achievements include sending spacecraft to the International Space Station, launching a satellite constellation to provide internet access, and conducting manned space missions. Central to SpaceX's success is its innovative reuse of the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket, which reduces launch costs to $62 million, compared to upwards of $165 million charged by other providers who cannot reuse this component.

This cost advantage underscores the importance of determining whether the first stage of a rocket can be reused, as it directly impacts the affordability of a launch. Using public data and machine learning models, we aim to predict the likelihood of the first stage successfully landing and being reused, which can inform the pricing and feasibility of launches for SpaceX and its competitors.
